## 6. Event-Based Instructional Plans

These plans provide the learning framework for multi-day events, conferences, or retreats with embedded training elements. They typically include pre-event prep materials, facilitator guides, session blueprints, breakout group instructions, and assessment strategies. Designed to align with learning objectives and event flow, they help instructional designers maintain pedagogical rigor in environments that combine networking, hands-on activities, and formal learning.
