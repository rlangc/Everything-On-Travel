## 7. Post-Travel Learning & Reporting

This category focuses on capturing and assessing learning outcomes once travel-based instruction concludes. It may include reflective journals, knowledge-sharing reports, surveys, and final assessments to evaluate the impact of the learning experience. These tools ensure that insights gained during travel are retained, shared, and applied, supporting continuous improvement and alignment with instructional goals.
