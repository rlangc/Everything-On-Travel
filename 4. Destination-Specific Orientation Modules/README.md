## 4. Destination-Specific Orientation Modules

These modules prepare learners, staff, or traveling teams to engage effectively and respectfully in different cultural and geographic contexts. They may include information on local customs, health regulations, emergency procedures, language basics, and region-specific compliance needs (like data privacy laws or international security policies). Such modules enhance cultural competence, reduce risk, and support more meaningful engagement in global or cross-border learning initiatives.
