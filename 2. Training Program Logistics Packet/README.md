## 2. Training Program Logistics Packet

A training logistics packet serves as the operational backbone for any offsite learning program or training-intensive travel event. It consolidates all essential information for attendees, including agendas, travel protocols, venue access, health and safety guidance, accommodation details, dietary arrangements, and local navigation tips. By reducing ambiguity, it allows both facilitators and learners to stay focused on learning outcomes rather than administrative logistics.
