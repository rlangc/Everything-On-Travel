## 3. Hospitality and Customer Service Training Guides

These guides are designed for onboarding and upskilling hospitality staff, especially those in service-heavy roles such as front desk, concierge, or event support. They typically cover core competencies like interpersonal communication, cultural awareness, service recovery strategies, and guest experience excellence, often through scenario-based learning. Instructional designers can leverage these guides to create interactive training modules, checklists, and SOPs tailored to hotel, travel, or tourism settings.
